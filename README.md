## ⚠️ Windows Defender/SmartScreen Warning

This app is not code-signed due to the high cost for indie developers. As a result, Windows may warn you that the file is unrecognised or potentially unsafe.  
If you downloaded this app from our official GitHub releases, it is safe to use.  
If you see a warning, you can right-click the file, select "Properties", and check "Unblock", or allow it in Windows Defender.
